# LB-LMC Solver C++ Code Generation Library

C++ code generation library for the development of real-time simulation solvers of multi-physics electrical and power electronic systems, utilizing the Latency-Based Linear Multistep Compound (LB-LMC) method.

Utilizing this library and FPGA High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, real-time simulation solvers of sizable power electronic systems executing on FPGA devices with 50ns simulation time steps are feasible.

## Requirements

This library requires C++11 or higher.

Besides the C++ standard library, this library depends on the following third-party libaries to compile:

  * Eigen 3 -- Linear Algebra Template Library
